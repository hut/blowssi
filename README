blowssi - an mircryption/FiSH compatible irssi script
John "Gothi[c]" Sennesael, donationcoder.com

Requires:
  * perl >= 5.8.8
  * Crypt::ircBlowfish (see bundeled zip file)
  * Crypt::CBC
  * MIME:Base64
  * irssi >= 0.8.0

Installation:

  (first make sure requirements are installed, see Requires above)

  To install, just put the script in ~/.irssi/scripts
  and put this in your ~/.irssi/startup  :

    /load ~/.irssi/scripts/blowssi.pl

Usage commands: 

  /blowon  :  Turns encryption back on after you used /blowoff (it's on by default)
              note that blowssi will not attempt to encrypt/decrypt in channels without key anyway.
              This is just for convenience in case you don't want to use the backtick (`) method. (see notes)

  /blowoff :  Causes encryption and decryption to be skipped for all channels, even with key.

  /blowkey channel key :  sets a key for a channel or nickname (for pm queries) 
                          eg: /blowkey #mircryption test
                              /blowkey Gothi[c] foo
                          Note that you must use the # character for channels.

  /blowdel channel     :  Removes a key for a channel or nickname (query), effectively disabeling encryption.

Usage Notes:

  * When you start a message with a backtick (`), encryption will be bypassed.
  * When you prepend a key with cbc: CBC encryption will be used instead of ECB.

Files:

  ~/.irssi/blowssi.conf   : The blowssi configuration file that lists all keys for each channel/nick. 
                            Syntax is channel:key
                            example: #mircryption:test
                                     #foo:cbc:bar
